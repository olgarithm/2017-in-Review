	<h1>2017 in Review</h1>
	<p> This is the result of me getting an iPad Pro and being bored over winter break. I hope you enjoy~</p>
	<h2>Make New Friends, but Keep the Old</h2>
	<p>Here are some Facebook related facts and figures. I tried to use the Facebook API to get this information, but all the endpoints were dead ends because of privacy issues (even though I only wanted to find and use my own data...) So instead, I grabbed them using a script that runs over my personal activity feed and graphed them using Chart.js. The last graph is based on interactions through comments, likes, and reactions.</p>

	<h2>Some Failures</h2>
	<p>You're not doing life correctly if you're not failing from time to time. Here lie the repressed memories of my failures:</p>
